      Chapter 1.1 – Why so many Expats consider Thailand
    </h3>
    
<div class="chapter-content">
    <h4>
      Why Thailand is Attractive to Expats
    </h4>
    <p>
      Thailand is a desirable location for expats for a variety of reasons:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Affordable cost of living:
        </strong>
        <br>
        Thailand offers a relatively low cost of living compared to many Western
        countries, making it an attractive option for those looking to stretch
        their retirement savings or enjoy a more comfortable lifestyle.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Beautiful natural scenery:
        </strong>
        <br>
        From stunning beaches to lush jungles and picturesque mountains, Thailand
        boasts a diverse range of natural beauty that appeals to many expats.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Warm and welcoming culture:
        </strong>
        <br>
        Thai people are known for their hospitality and friendliness, making it
        easy for expats to feel at home and build connections with locals.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Accessible healthcare:
        </strong>
        <br>
        Thailand has a well-developed healthcare system, with modern facilities
        and highly trained medical professionals offering affordable and high-quality
        care.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Vibrant expat community:
        </strong>
        <br>
        Many cities in Thailand, including Chiang Mai, have established expat
        communities that provide support, social connections, and opportunities
        for networking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Delicious food:
        </strong>
        <br>
        Thai cuisine is renowned for its rich flavors and variety, offering expats
        a culinary adventure to enjoy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Ease of travel
        </strong>
        <br>
        throughout Asia and of course Bangkok is a gateway to the entire world
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          The availability and relative ease of obtaining long-term stay visas.
        </strong>
        <br>
        The Thai government offers several visa options for foreigners looking
        to stay in the country for an extended period. (See section 1.4 below for
        more information)
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4>
      Popular Expat Destinations in Thailand
    </h4>
    <p>
      When considering relocation to Thailand, many people tend to focus on
      3 types of options:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Big City
        </strong>
        Bangkok is a world-class city by any definition. Like the great cities
        of the world (London, New York, Frankfort, Sydney, Beijing, etc.) it has
        a beautiful cityscape, highrises, public transportation, culture, great
        restaurants, and lots of traffic!!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Smaller Big City
        </strong>
        Chiang Mai offers a stark contrast to Bangkok's bustling metropolis,
        providing a more relaxed and authentic Thai experience. As Thailand's
        second-largest city, Chiang Mai boasts a population of approximately 1.2
        million, significantly smaller than Bangkok's 11 million residents.
        Its lack of high-rise buildings and sprawling urban development allows
        for a more intimate and laid-back atmosphere.
        <p>
          In addition to its smaller size, Chiang Mai is also known for being more
          budget-friendly compared to Bangkok. Expats can expect lower accommodation
          and transportation costs, as well as more affordable dining options. This
          affordability, coupled with the city's rich cultural heritage and
          proximity to natural wonders, makes Chiang Mai an attractive option for
          expats seeking a more serene lifestyle in Thailand.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Beach Communities
        </strong>
        There are plenty of fantastic beach communities in Thailand that offer
        unique experiences for expats. Some popular options include:
        <p>
          <strong>
            Phuket
          </strong>
          <br>
          Known for its beautiful beaches, vibrant nightlife, and diverse entertainment
          options, Phuket is a popular choice for expats who enjoy an active social
          scene.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Hua Hin
          </strong>
          <br>
          This coastal town offers a more laid-back atmosphere with a mix of traditional
          Thai culture and modern amenities.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Koh Samui
          </strong>
          <br>
          For those seeking tropical paradise, Koh Samui is known for its crystal-clear
          waters, palm-fringed beaches, and luxurious resorts.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Pattaya
          </strong>
          <br>
          Offering a vibrant nightlife, entertainment venues, and a variety of water
          sports, Pattaya is a bustling beach town that caters to a wide range of
          interests.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      These are just a few examples, and each beach community has its own charm
      and character.

      Chapter 1.2 – Why consider Chiang Mai?
    </h3>

   <div class="chapter-content">
    <h4>
      Chiang Mai: The Rose of the North
    </h4>
    <p>
      Chiang Mai is a vibrant city located in northern Thailand. It is
      renowned for its rich history, beautiful landscapes, and cultural heritage.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Location and Geography:
    </h4>
    <p>
      Chiang Mai is the second largest city in Thailand, with a population of
      approximately 1.3 million. It is known as The Rose of the North. Chiang
      Mai is situated in a mountainous region, surrounded by lush greenery and
      forests. The city is approximately 700 kilometres north of Bangkok and
      is the capital of the Chiang Mai Province.
    </p>
    <h4>
      Weather
    </h4>
    <p>
      Chiang Mai experiences a tropical climate, with three distinct seasons.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>
          The hot season (March to June):
        </strong>
        Temperatures range from approximately 30°C (86°F) to 38°C (100°F), with
        high humidity levels.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          The rainy season (July to October):
        </strong>
        Expect frequent rain showers and thunderstorms, with temperatures ranging
        from about 25°C (77°F) to 32°C (90°F).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          The cool season (November to February):
        </strong>
        This is the most comfortable time to visit Chiang Mai, with temperatures
        ranging from about 15°C (59°F) to 28°C (82°F) and less rainfall.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The weather in Chiang Mai can be unpredictable, so it is always a
      good idea to pack an umbrella or raincoat, especially during the rainy
      season!

        <ul>
          <li>
            Thailand has recently launched a new &#8220;Destination Thailand Visa&#8221;
            (DTV) specifically designed for digital nomads, allowing remote workers
            to stay in the country for up to five years.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prior to this, digital nomads could only stay in Thailand for up to 60
            days on a tourist visa, or obtain a difficult-to-get Long Term Residence
            Visa with steep financial requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
            The DTV aims to boost visitor numbers, revive the economy, and attract
            more remote workers to Thailand.
          </li>
          <li>
            To apply for the DTV, individuals must be self-employed or work for a
            company outside of Thailand, and meet certain requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
            The application fee is 10,000 Thai baht (approximately 252 euros), and
            the processing fee for a 10-year visa is 50,000 Thai baht per person.
          </li>
          <li>
            Overall, this new visa scheme is an exciting development for digital nomads
            looking to base themselves in Thailand and experience the country&#8217;s
            rich culture, beautiful scenery, and friendly people.

      <strong>
        Note:
      </strong>
      It is important to note that visa requirements and regulations can
      change, so it is advisable to consult the nearest Thai embassy or
      consulate or visit the official website of the Thai Ministry of Foreign
      Affairs for the most up-to-date information before planning your trip or
      stay in Chiang Mai.

      Chapter 1.5 – Getting to Chiang Mai
    </h3>

<div class="chapter-content">
    <p>
      Getting to Chiang Mai is easy thanks to its well-connected transportation
      infrastructure. Here are the primary ways to reach Chiang Mai:
    </p>
    <h4>
        Air
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Chiang Mai International Airport (CNX)
        </strong>

        is already underway.
      </li>
      <li>
        Direct flights to Chiang Mai are available from major cities in Thailand

        flights to Chiang Mai.
      </li>

    <p>
      While most people arrive in Bangkok as their first Thai point of entry,
      there may be an advantage of flying directly to Chiang Mai – especially
      if you have lots of luggage. You may find it easier to clear customs in
      CM and avoid transferring your luggage to domestic carrier. The cost of
      your flight options is of course a primary concern as well.
    </p>
    <h4>

        Station) to Chiang Mai Railway Station.
        <strong>
          NOTE:
        </strong>
        It is a real treat to take the overnight train between Bangkok and Chiang
        Mai! Each way departs about 6:00PM and arrives at about 7:00AM the next
        day. The seats convert to a bed. It is awesome!
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        Bus
    </h4>
    <ul>

      </li>
      <li>
        Several bus companies operate services to Chiang Mai, with departures
        from Bangkok's Northern Bus Terminal (Mo Chit) and other locations.

        Major highways connect Chiang Mai with cities like Lampang, Chiang Rai,
        and Mae Hong Son.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
       Minivan
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Minivans provide a faster alternative to buses for travelling between
        nearby cities and towns.
      </li>

          Consider Overnight Trains or Buses:
        </strong>
        Overnight trains or buses from Bangkok to Chiang Mai can save time and
        accommodation costs. Note: These options may be particularly attractive
        if you are travelling with lots of luggage and wish to avoid airline baggage
        fees.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Choose Reputable Operators:
        </strong>
        When travelling by bus or minivan, choose reputable operators with good
        safety records.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Check Visa Requirements:
        </strong>
        Ensure you have the necessary visa or entry requirements for Thailand
        depending on your nationality.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Chiang Mai is a popular destination in Thailand with excellent transport
      links, making it accessible from various locations within the country and
      internationally.

    <p>
      It is important to remember that we are visitors here. Thai culture has
      evolved here for many centuries. It is important to be mindful of
      our hosts’ culture and customs to show respect and appreciation for the
      local way of life. Thais are a very welcoming and friendly people (as well
      as being incredibly honest!). Here are some cultural tips and advice for
      navigating Chiang Mai's cultural landscape:
    </p>
    <h4>
        Respect for Buddhism
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Thailand is 98% Buddhist, and temples (wats) hold significant cultural
        and religious importance.
      </li>
      <li>
        When visiting temples, dress modestly (covering shoulders and knees) and
        remove shoes before entering temple buildings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Show respect by not pointing your feet towards Buddha statues or monks.
        Do not touch the monks.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        Greetings and Politeness
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use the traditional Thai greeting called the <em>wai</em> (placing
        palms together in a prayer-like gesture) when meeting locals, especially
        elders or those in positions of respect.
      </li>
      <li>
        Address people respectfully using <em>khun</em> (equivalent to <em>Mr.</em>  or  <em>Ms.</em>) followed by their first name.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        Modesty in Dress
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        While Chiang Mai is generally more relaxed compared to Bangkok, it is
        respectful to dress modestly, especially when visiting temples or in rural
        areas.
      </li>
      <li>
        Avoid overly revealing clothing, particularly in religious or conservative
        settings.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        Footwear Etiquette
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It has been customary to remove shoes before entering someone's
        home, temples, or certain shops and establishments. Many still adhere to
        this custom. You will likely be provided a good clue by checking to see
        if there are shoe racks (or simply pairs of loose shoes) outside an establishment.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        Cultural Sensitivity
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Avoid public displays of affection, especially in conservative areas.
      </li>
      <li>
        Refrain from touching a Thai person's head, as the head is considered
        sacred in Thai culture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Be mindful of local customs and traditions, and observe how locals behave
        in different situations.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        Eating and Dining Etiquette
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When dining with others, wait for the host or elder to start eating before
        you begin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Thais tend to use a spoon (not a fork) to eat most dishes, and use chopsticks
        for noodle dishes. It is not common to see table knives used here.
      </li>
      <li>
        When at someone's home, try to finish all the food on your plate to show
        appreciation.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        Language and Communication
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Learn a few basic Thai phrases such as <em>sawasdee kha/krab</em> (hello),
         <em>khob khun kha/krab</em> (thank you), and <em>khor tort</em> (excuse me).
      </li>
      <li>
        Speak calmly and avoid raising your voice, as Thais value harmony and
        politeness.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        Respecting the Monarchy
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Thai monarchy is highly revered, and it is important to show
        respect towards the King and Royal Family.
      </li>
      <li>
        Avoid any disrespectful comments or actions related to the monarchy, as
        this can be considered a serious - even criminal - offense
        in Thailand.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        Tipping and Payments
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Tipping is not mandatory but appreciated, especially in tourist areas
        or for exceptional service.
      </li>
      <li>
        In restaurants, rounding up the bill or leaving a small tip (10-20 baht)
        is common practice.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
        Patience and Smiling
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Thais appreciate patience, politeness, and a friendly demeanour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Smile often and remain calm in all interactions, even if faced with language
        barriers or misunderstandings.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By embracing these cultural tips and demonstrating respect for Thai customs,
      you will create positive interactions and experiences while exploring
      Chiang Mai and immersing yourself in the local culture. Thais are generally
      welcoming and gracious hosts, and showing cultural sensitivity will help
      foster meaningful connections and enrich your time in this beautiful city.

      Chapter 1.7 – Getting mobile phone service before arrival
    </h3> 

<div class="chapter-content">
    <p>
      Mobile phone service in Thailand is of high quality, consistently reliable,
      and quite inexpensive. (Intriguingly, the only thing Thais seem to NOT
      do on the phone is to talk!) In terms of mobile service, the data plan
      is of primary importance; not voice or text.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obtaining an eSIM before departing for Thailand can offer several advantages
      over purchasing a local SIM card upon arrival. Here are a few key benefits:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Convenience
        </strong>
        With an eSIM, you can activate your international data plan before you
        even leave your home country. This means you will have immediate internet
        access when you land, without having to locate and purchase a local SIM
        card.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Cost savings
        </strong>
        Many eSIM providers offer competitive international data plans that can
        be more affordable than buying local SIM cards, particularly if you are
        traveling to multiple countries.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Keep your original number
        </strong>
        By using an eSIM for data, you can continue to use your primary phone
        number for calls and texts via Wi-Fi-based messaging apps. This allows
        you to stay connected with your contacts without having to update your
        information or carry multiple devices.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Eco-friendly
        </strong>
        As eSIMs are digital, there is no need to dispose of or replace physical
        SIM cards, reducing waste and making it a more environmentally friendly
        option.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Easy to manage
        </strong>
        You can switch between multiple eSIM profiles directly on your device,
        making it easier to manage your international data plans and switch providers
        if needed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Overall, getting an eSIM before traveling abroad can offer convenience,
      cost savings, and flexibility while keeping you connected with your personal
      and professional networks.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use your favorite search engine or AI app to find the best eSIM
      for you (lots of good YouTube videos as well). A couple we are familiar
      with are FlexiRoam and Nomad.

      Chapter 1.8 – What to do with your existing mobile phone number
    </h3>

 <div class="chapter-content">
   <p>
      Keeping your mobile phone number from your home country can be advantageous
      for expats in various ways. Firstly, it ensures that you maintain continuity
      in your personal and professional communications as you settle into your
      new life abroad. Your contacts will still be able to reach you at the same
      number, and you will not have to update your details on numerous platforms.
      Secondly, retaining your existing number allows you to keep using certain
      services that might not be easily accessible from foreign numbers or require
      local verification. Finally, maintaining your original phone number can
      help you stay connected with important institutions such as banks and government
      agencies, making it easier to manage affairs in your home country even
      while living abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      For those from the US, one can port one's mobile number to Google Voice
      essentially for free, and continue to receive voice messages and text messages
      to that number without monthly fees. This is especially helpful when one
      needs to receive Two Factor Authentication (2FA) texts from an account/bank
      that has one’s phone number associated with the account.
    </p>
    <p>
      For people moving to Thailand from countries other than the US, there
      are still some options available that can provide similar functionality
      to Google Voice:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Skype
        </strong>
        Skype offers the "Skype Number" feature, which is available
        in many countries, including Australia, UK, Canada, and others. This feature
        allows you to receive calls and texts to a dedicated phone number.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Localphone
        </strong>
        Localphone provides virtual phone numbers for a variety of countries,
        so users from Australia, UK, Canada, and other countries can purchase a
        phone number from their home country and use it to receive calls and texts
        while in Thailand.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          TextNow
        </strong>
        While TextNow primarily offers US phone numbers, they also provide Canadian
        phone numbers. Users from Canada can use TextNow to maintain their Canadian
        phone number while living in Thailand.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Please note that availability and features of these services may vary
      depending on the user&#8217;s home country.

      Chapter 1.9 – Why you should start getting acquainted with Google Maps
        and/or Apple Maps
    </h3>

<div class="chapter-content">
    
    <p>
      Mapping applications like Google Maps or Apple Maps are invaluable tools
      for travellers exploring a new country. They provide instant access to
      detailed information about your surroundings and allow you to navigate
      unfamiliar environments with confidence. These apps offer real-time location
      tracking, turn-by-turn directions, and local search functionality, making
      it easy to find nearby restaurants, hotels, and attractions. They also
      provide various transportation options, such as driving, public transit,
      walking, and cycling routes, along with estimated travel times.
      <br>
      Knowing how to use these apps can save you time and reduce the stress
      of navigating a new country, allowing you to focus on enjoying your travel
      experiences and making the most of your time abroad. Furthermore, being
      able to pinpoint your location in a foreign place can also enhance your
      personal safety and ensure that you never get lost.

      On the other hand:

        to its Bangkok office!)

      <li>
        Some bank employees speak other languages, but many do not

      Chapter 3.2 – How to get there – Walking
    </h3>

<div class="chapter-content">
    <p>
      Walking is a GREAT way to get around in Chiang Mai. You will notice much
      more detail about your surrounding than when driving. Crossing streets
      in Chiang Mai can be an adventure due to the city's busy traffic
      and the lack of formal pedestrian infrastructure in some areas. Here are
      some tips to help you cross streets safely in Chiang Mai:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Use Designated Crosswalks/Pedestrian Crossings
        </strong>
        <br>
        When available, always use designated crosswalks or pedestrian signals.
        However, be aware that not all drivers may stop for pedestrians, even at
        crosswalks.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Find a Safe Spot
        </strong>
        <br>
        If there are no crosswalks, find a spot where you have a clear view of
        the oncoming traffic in both directions. This allows you to gauge the speed
        and distance of vehicles more accurately.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Follow Local Pedestrians
        </strong>
        <br>
        Observe how locals cross the streets. They often have experience with
        the traffic patterns and can show you the best practices. Crossing with
        a group can also make drivers more likely to slow down.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Make Eye Contact
        </strong>
        <br>
        Try to make eye contact with approaching drivers to ensure they see you.
        This can also give you an indication of whether they intend to stop or
        slow down.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Be Patient and Decisive
        </strong>
        <br>
        Wait for a gap in the traffic before crossing. Once you decide to cross,
        do so confidently but remain vigilant. Hesitation can confuse drivers and
        increase the risk.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Look Both Ways
        </strong>
        <br>
        Even if the traffic appears to be coming from one direction, look both
        ways. Motorcycles and scooters often navigate through traffic and can come
        from unexpected directions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Watch Out for Motorbikes
        </strong>
        <br>
        Motorbikes are common in Chiang Mai and can be more difficult to spot
        than cars. Be especially careful when crossing streets with heavy motorbike
        traffic.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Use Pedestrian Bridges
        </strong>
        <br>
        In some areas, pedestrian bridges are available. They are a safer alternative
        to crossing busy streets at ground level.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Nighttime Caution
        </strong>
        <br>
        Visibility is lower at night, so take extra care when crossing streets
        after dark. Wear light-colored clothing or something reflective if possible.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Traffic Laws Awareness
        </strong>
        <br>
        Be aware that traffic laws may not be as strictly enforced as in some
        other countries. Drivers might not always yield to pedestrians, so do not
        assume you have the right of way.

      Chapter 3.3 – How to get there – Ride Sharing
    </h3>

<div class="chapter-content">
    <p>
      Using ride-sharing services in Chiang Mai, Thailand, is a very convenient
      and affordable way to get around the city. When using a ride-sharing app
      in Chiang Mai, the app will automatically translate the customer's
      request and destination into Thai for the driver. However, it is important
      to note that these translations may not always be perfect, so there may
      be some misunderstandings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most popular destinations will be searchable in the service’s app which
      minimizes the language barrier. If your destination is not listed, it is
      a good idea to have your destination written in Thai or to use a map application
      to show the driver the location. Additionally, being patient and polite
      can go a long way in overcoming any communication difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike in some other countries, you will not be required to have your
      credit card info stored on the app. You may pay cash directly to the driver
      or, if you have a Thai bank account, you may pay by scanning a QR code.
      Very convenient!
    </p>
    <p>
      The first and most popular service is Grab. Others, like Bolt, iDrive,
      and Maxim are also viable options. The services may vary in terms of cost
      and wait times so it is good to have several on your phone to choose from.

      Chapter 3.4 – How to get there – Taxi/Tuk Tuk
    </h3>


  <div class="chapter-content">
    <h4>

        Taxis

    </h4>
    <p>
      Taxis are not as popular in Chiang Mai since ride-share apps became popular.
      But they are still very common as an option from the airport, train station,
      and some tourist locations. If you use one, make sure to either agree on
      the fare before you start the journey, or agree that the driver will use
      the meter.
    </p>
    <h4>

        Tuk Tuk

    </h4>
    <p>
      <strong>
        What is a tuk tuk?
      </strong>
      <br>
      A tuk tuk is a three-wheeled vehicle that is commonly used as a mode
      of transportation in Thailand, especially in cities like Chiang Mai. They are
      usually colorful and open-air, providing a unique and fun way to explore
      the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        How to hire a tuk tuk
      </strong>
      <br>
      Tuk tuks can be found all around Chiang Mai, especially near popular tourist
      attractions. To hire one, simply wave down an available tuk tuk driver
      and tell them where you want to go. You can also use ride-hailing apps
      like Grab to book a tuk tuk in advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Negotiating fares
      </strong>
      <br>
      Before starting your ride, it is essential to agree on a fare with
      the driver. Tuk tuk drivers may try to charge higher prices for tourists,
      so it is best to ask your hotel or a local friend for an estimate
      of what a fair price would be. Always negotiate and do not be afraid
      to walk away if the driver refuses to agree on a reasonable fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Tuk tuk tours
      </strong>
      <br>
      If you want to explore Chiang Mai's sights in a fun and unique way,
      consider taking a tuk tuk tour. These tours usually last for a few hours
      and take you to several attractions within the city. Many hotels and tour
      agencies can help you arrange a tuk tuk tour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using tuk tuks in Chiang Mai can be an enjoyable and memorable experience,
      as long as you negotiate fares and ensure you are paying a fair price.
      Happy riding!

      Chapter 3.5 – How to get there – Red Vans
    </h3>

<div class="chapter-content">
    <p>
      In Chiang Mai, the red vans are known as  <em>songthaews</em> or <em>rod
      daeng</em>, which translates to <em>two benches</em> or <em>red
      car</em>, respectively. They are a popular and affordable mode of transportation
      for both locals and tourists.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        How to use songthaews
      </strong>
      <br>
      Songthaews usually operate on fixed routes, and you can wave one down
      on the side of the road. When you board, let the driver know where you
      want to go, and they will drop you off at your destination or the closest
      point on their route.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Fares and payment
      </strong>
      <br>
      Fares for songthaews vary depending on the distance traveled. Typically,
      rides within the city center cost around 20-30 baht per person. Before
      boarding, it is a good idea to ask the driver for the fare to avoid
      any surprises.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Tips for using songthaews
      </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Be prepared to share the ride with other passengers, as songthaews often
        pick up and drop off multiple people along their route.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carry small bills and coins to make it easier to pay the fare.
      </li>
      <li>
        Learn a few basic Thai phrases for communication, such as "where
        are you going?" and "how much is the fare?"
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Using songthaews in Chiang Mai is an easy, affordable, and fun way to
      explore the city. Just remember to communicate with the driver and enjoy
      the ride!

      Chapter 3.7 – Driving in Chiang Mai
    </h3>

<div class="chapter-content">
    <p>
      <strong>
        Driving in Chiang Mai can be quite an adventure! Here is a general
        overview:
      </strong>
    </p>
    <h4>

        Left-hand drive

    </h4>
    <p>
      Thailand follows the left-hand drive system, which might take some getting
      used to if you are from a country with right-hand drive.
    </p>
    <h4>

        Traffic and congestion

    </h4>
    <p>
      Chiang Mai's traffic can be busy, especially during rush hours and
      in popular tourist areas. However, it is generally less hectic than
      Bangkok. Be prepared for traffic jams and keep an eye out for motorbikes
      weaving in and out of cars.
    </p>
    <h4>

        Thai drivers

    </h4>
    <p>
      Thai drivers are generally courteous and patient, but their driving style
      may be different from what you are used to. You should be aware that
      it is clear that Thai drivers were not taught to "drive defensively! " They
      seem to believe that they can turn onto a road or change lanes without
      regard to others. Having said that, once you become accustomed to this
      <em>style</em> of driving, you will quickly get the hang of it. Keep in mind that
      honking is uncommon, and Thai drivers very rarely become aggressive or
      angry.
    </p>
    <h4>

        Motorbikes and motorcycles

    </h4>
    <p>
      Motorbikes and motorcycles are a popular mode of transportation in Chiang
      Mai. However, it is essential to exercise caution when driving or
      riding one, as accidents are more common. Always wear a helmet, follow
      traffic rules, and be aware of your surroundings.
    </p>
    <h4>

        Riding a bicycle

    </h4>
    <p>
      Bicycles are a great way to explore Chiang Mai's quieter streets
      and scenic areas. However, be cautious when riding alongside motorbikes
      and cars, as they may not always give you enough space. Stick to designated
      bicycle lanes when available, and always wear a helmet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, driving in Chiang Mai can be enjoyable as long as you remain
      alert, adapt to local driving customs, and follow traffic rules. Happy
      driving!
    </p>
    <h4>

        Traffic and How to get around

    </h4>
    <p>
      The traffic situation in Chiang Mai is currently challenging due to ongoing
      infrastructure work and increased vehicle usage. The city has significant
      congestion. The average commute time is around 25 minutes, with most people
      travelling by car. Additionally, the region has been grappling with environmental
      issues such as forest fires, which have further impacted traffic and air
      quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Motorbikes and public transportation options like buses are also common,
      but traffic inefficiency remains high, contributing to longer travel times
      and higher CO2 emissions.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are planning to travel in or around Chiang Mai, it’s advisable
      to check local news for updates on traffic conditions and plan your trips
      outside peak hours to avoid delays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Driving in Chiang Mai in general, involves adhering to several traffic
      rules and being aware of local driving behaviours. Here are some key points
      to consider:
    </p>
    <h4>

        Traffic Rules and Regulations

    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Driving Side:
        </strong>
        In Thailand, vehicles drive on the left side of the road.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Speed Limits:
        </strong>
        Speed limits are generally set at 60 km/h in urban areas and up to 120
        km/h on highways, but always look out for specific signs indicating speed
        limits as they can vary.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Helmet and Seat Belt Laws:
        </strong>
        Helmets are mandatory for motorbike riders and passengers. Seat belts
        are required for all passengers in a vehicle.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Road Signs:
        </strong>
        Familiarize yourself with common road signs such as stop signs, no entry
        signs, and speed limit indicators. The signs often include text in Thai,
        so learning some basic Thai terms for traffic signs can be beneficial.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Right of Way:
        </strong>
        Larger vehicles generally have the right of way. Be cautious at intersections
        and always give way to trucks and buses.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>

        Common Driving Practices

    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Motorbikes:
        </strong>
        Motorbikes are a common mode of transportation and often weave through
        traffic. Be vigilant as they may not always adhere to traffic signals or
        lane discipline.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Pedestrians:
        </strong>
        Pedestrian crossings are not always respected. Pedestrians may dart across
        the road unpredictably, so always stay alert.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Overtaking:
        </strong>
        It is common for vehicles, including motorbikes, to overtake from both
        the left and right. Always check your mirrors and blind spots before changing
        lanes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Traffic Signals:
        </strong>
        While there are traffic lights, enforcement can be lax. Do not assume
        that all drivers will stop at red lights or follow the signal order strictly.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>

        Safety Tips

    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Defensive Driving:
        </strong>
        Given the unpredictable nature of traffic, drive defensively. Anticipate
        erratic manoeuvrers from other drivers and keep a safe distance from the
        vehicle in front.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Road Conditions:
        </strong>
        Be cautious of road conditions, especially after the rainy season when
        potholes and uneven surfaces are more common.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Interacting with Police:
        </strong>
        If stopped by traffic police, remain calm and respectful. Have your documentation
        ready, including your driver’s license, vehicle registration (copy of Blue
        Book – not the original), and, if you are a tourist, your passport.
        If a fine is payable, pay it and do not argue with the police.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Parking:
        </strong>
        Parking can be challenging in busy areas. Look for designated parking
        zones and be aware of parking fees, which vary depending on the area.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By understanding these rules and common practices, you can navigate the
      roads of Chiang Mai more safely and confidently.

      Chapter 3.8 – Buying a Vehicle
    </h3>

<div class="chapter-content">

    <p>
      Buying a vehicle in Chiang Mai involves several steps, whether you are
      looking for a new or used car. Here is a guide to help you navigate
      the process:
    </p>
    <h3>
      <strong>
        1. Determine Your Needs and Budget:
      </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Type of Vehicle:
      </strong>
      Consider what type of vehicle suits your needs best. Chiang Mai's
      diverse terrain may require anything from compact cars for city driving
      to SUVs for rural or mountainous areas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Set a budget for your purchase, including the cost of the car, insurance,
      registration, and potential repairs.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <strong>
        2. New vs. Used Cars:
      </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>
        New Cars:
      </strong>
      For new vehicles, you can visit local dealerships of brands like Toyota,
      Honda, and Ford, which offer a range of models. Websites like ZigWheels
      provide detailed information on new car prices and features available in
      Thailand.

        <strong>
          Short-Term Rentals:

      <li>
        <strong>
          Long-Term Rentals:

        For stays longer than six months, commonly one-year leases. These agreements
        are more formal and detailed.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>
      <strong>
        Key Components of a Rental Agreement:

          Rent:

        <strong>
          Deposit:
        </strong>
        Typically, a security deposit equivalent to one or two months&#8217; rent
        is required. This is refundable at the end of the lease, provided no damage
        has occurred.
      </li>
      <li>

      Chapter 4.2 – Finding Accommodation – Buying
    </h3>

<div class="chapter-content">
    <p>
      Buying property in Chiang Mai involves specific legal and practical considerations,
      especially for foreign buyers. Here is a comprehensive guide to help
      you navigate the process:
    </p>
    <h3>
      <strong>
        Legal Considerations
      </strong>
    </h3>
    <p>
      It is very important to consult a lawyer before embarking on any property
      transaction.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Foreign Ownership Rules:
        </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Condos: Foreigners can own up to 49% of the total area of all condominium
            units in a single project. This is the most straightforward property type
            for foreigners to purchase.
          </li>
          <li>
            Land: Foreigners cannot own land directly but can lease it for up to 30
            years, with an option to renew. Another common method is to form a Thai
            company with Thai majority ownership, though this approach has legal complexities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Houses: Foreigners can own the structure (house) but not the land it sits
            on. A common practice is to lease the land long-term and own the house.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Due Diligence:
        </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Legal Advice: Engage a reputable lawyer who specializes in Thai property
            law to conduct due diligence on the property, ensuring clear title and
            compliance with all laws.
          </li>
          <li>
            Title Deeds: Verify the title deed with the Land Department. The most
            secure form is the Chanote title deed, which provides full ownership rights.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Financing:
        </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Loans: Obtaining a mortgage as a foreigner can be challenging, as most
            Thai banks offer limited financing options. Some international banks and
            specialized financial institutions provide loans to foreigners.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cash Purchases: Many foreigners opt to buy property outright to avoid
            financing complications.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

            Property Inspection: Physically inspect the property to assess its condition
            and surroundings.

            has no legal encumbrances.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>

        <ul>
          <li>

          </li>
          <li>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Transfer of Ownership:
        </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Land Department: The final step involves transferring the property at
            the Land Department. Both buyer and seller (or their representatives) must
            be present.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fees and Taxes: Be prepared to pay transfer fees (around 2% of the assessed
            property value), stamp duty, and possibly specific business tax if the
            property has been owned for less than five years.

        General Tips for Negotiating Prices
      </strong>
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Do Your Research:
        </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Market Rates: Understand the going rates for the item or property you&#8217;re
            interested in. For property, look at comparable sales in the area. For
            goods, visit a few different vendors to get a sense of the typical price
            range.
          </li>
          <li>
            Local Customs: Learn the local customs and norms around bargaining. In
            some settings, negotiation is expected and part of the buying process.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Build Rapport:
        </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Be Polite and Friendly: A smile and a friendly attitude can go a long
            way in negotiations. Building a good rapport with the seller can make them
            more willing to offer a better price.
          </li>
          <li>
            Language: Learning a few basic phrases in Thai can show respect and endear
            you to the seller, even if you conduct most of the negotiation in English.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Be Prepared to Walk Away:
        </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Confidence: Show that you’re willing to walk away if the price doesn’t
            meet your expectations. Often, the seller may offer a better deal to keep
            your business.
          </li>
          <li>
            Alternatives: Have a backup plan or an alternative vendor in mind. This
            gives you leverage in negotiations.

      Chapter 4.6 – Water and Ice
    </h3>

<div class="chapter-content">
    <p>
      When it comes to water and ice in Chiang Mai, it is important to
      consider safety and quality, as tap water is generally not safe to drink.
      Here are some key points to keep in mind:
    </p>
    <h3>
      <strong>
        Drinking Water
      </strong>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Bottled Water:
        </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Safety:
            </strong>
            Bottled water is widely available and is the safest option for drinking.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Brands:
            </strong>
            Popular brands include Singha, Chang, Nestlé, and Crystal.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Where to Buy:
            </strong>
            You can buy bottled water at supermarkets (Big C, Tesco Lotus), convenience
            stores (7-Eleven, Family Mart), and local shops.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Filtered Water:
        </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Water Dispensers:
            </strong>
            Many apartments and residential areas have coin-operated water dispensers
            that filter tap water. These are generally safe and a cost-effective option
            for drinking water.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Home Filters:
            </strong>
            Installing a home water filtration system is another option if you prefer
            not to buy bottled water regularly.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Water Delivery Services:
        </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Service:
            </strong>
            Companies offer large bottles (typically 20 litres) of drinking water
            delivered to your home.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Providers:
            </strong>
            Look for local water delivery services, which you can often arrange through
            your landlord or by contacting companies directly.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      <strong>
        Ice
      </strong>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Commercial Ice:
        </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Safety:
            </strong>
            Ice produced commercially and sold in bags is generally safe. It’s made
            from purified water and follows hygienic standards.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Where to Buy:
            </strong>
            Available at supermarkets, convenience stores, and local markets.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Usage:
            </strong>
            Suitable for drinking and cooling beverages.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Ice in Restaurants and Street Food:
        </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Safety:
            </strong>
            Most reputable restaurants and cafes use commercially produced ice, which
            is safe. However, exercise caution with ice from street vendors.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>
              Tips:
            </strong>
            When in doubt, ask if the ice is made from purified water. Look for cylindrical
            ice cubes with a hole in the middle, as these are typically factory-made
            and safer.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      <strong>
        Additional Tips
      </strong>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Avoid Tap Water:
        </strong>
        Do not drink tap water directly. It&#8217;s fine for brushing teeth, but
        use bottled or filtered water for drinking and cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Boiling Water:
        </strong>
        If necessary, boil tap water for at least one minute to kill any bacteria
        or pathogens before drinking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Personal Water Filter:
        </strong>
        Consider using a portable water filter (e.g., LifeStraw) when travelling
        or if you are unsure about the water quality.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Reusable Bottles:
        </strong>
        Use a reusable water bottle to reduce plastic waste. Many cafes and restaurants
        offer refills.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Water Safety in Hotels:
        </strong>
        Most hotels provide complimentary bottled water. Use this for drinking
        and brushing your teeth.

      Chapter 4.7 – Food – A general discussion
    </h3>

<div class="chapter-content">
    <p>

        Food plays a significant role in Thai culture, influencing social interactions,
        traditions, and the country's identity. Here are some key aspects
        highlighting the importance of food in Thailand:

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Social Interactions
        </strong>
        Thai meals are often communal affairs, with dishes placed in the center
        of the table for everyone to share. Eating alone is generally considered
        bad luck, so meals provide an opportunity for friends and family to come
        together, bond, and socialize.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Flavor Balance
        </strong>
        Thai cuisine strives for a harmonious balance of five primary flavors:
        sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and spicy. This balance is essential to the
        overall dining experience and represents the Thai philosophy of maintaining
        harmony in life.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Cultural Identity
        </strong>
        Thai food is a source of national pride and plays a crucial role in the
        country's cultural identity. Traditional dishes and cooking techniques
        have been passed down through generations, preserving the culinary heritage
        and ensuring its continued relevance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Festivals and Celebrations
        </strong>
        Food is central to many Thai festivals and celebrations, such as Songkran
        (Thai New Year) and Loy Krathong. Special dishes and treats are prepared
        and shared during these occasions, strengthening communal bonds and celebrating
        the country's rich cultural traditions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Street Food Culture
        </strong>
        Thailand's vibrant street food scene is an integral part of daily
        life. Locals and visitors alike flock to street vendors for quick, affordable,
        and delicious meals, contributing to the bustling atmosphere of cities
        like Bangkok and Chiang Mai.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Culinary Tourism
        </strong>
        Thai cuisine has gained worldwide popularity, attracting tourists from
        around the globe to experience authentic dishes and learn about Thai culture
        through its flavors and culinary traditions.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>
        In summary, food in Thailand is not just sustenance but an integral part
        of the country's cultural fabric, shaping social interactions, celebrations,
        and the nation's identity.

      Chapter 4.9 – Food – Shopping for Food
    </h3>

<div class="chapter-content">
    <p>
      A quick general comment – Many of us are accustomed to living in areas
      where it is less expensive to prepare our own food than it is to eat out
      at a restaurant. Surprisingly to many of us, this is not the case in Chiang
      Mai! It is generally quite a bit more expensive to buy food ingredients
      and cook them yourself than to eat in a restaurant. This remains a mystery
      to many of us! Of course, this does not deter those of us who love to cook.
      You can find modern grocery stores with a look and feel familiar to those

      <strong>
        Initial Interaction:
      </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Show Interest but Not Desperation: Express interest in the item but avoid
        showing that you’re overly eager to buy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ask for the Price: Inquire about the price first before making any counteroffer.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Making an Offer:
      </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Start Lower: Offer a price that’s about 30-50% lower than the initial
        asking price. This leaves room for negotiation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bundle Items: If you’re buying multiple items, ask for a discount on the
        total purchase. Vendors are often more willing to give a better deal on
        larger sales.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Use Silence and Pause:
      </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Wait for Their Response: After making an offer, remain silent and wait
        for the seller to respond. This can sometimes prompt them to lower the
        price without you needing to say more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pause Before Accepting: Even if the seller agrees to your offer, pause
        for a moment before accepting. This can sometimes lead to an even better
        deal.

        Ask for Discounts:
      </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Inquire Politely: Ask if there are any discounts or promotions, especially
        if you’re buying multiple items.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cash Payments: Sometimes, paying in cash can get you a better deal since
        it saves the seller credit card processing fees.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Leverage Competitors:
      </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Mention Alternatives: Politely mention if you’ve seen similar items at
        a lower price elsewhere. This can encourage the seller to match or beat
        the competitor’s price.

      <strong>
        Final Tips
      </strong>
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Stay Calm and Patient: Keep the negotiation process friendly and relaxed.
        Losing your temper or becoming impatient can negatively impact the outcome.
      </li>
      <li>
        Know When to Stop: Once you reach a fair price, stop negotiating. Pushing
        too hard can lead to the seller retracting their offer.
      </li>

      <strong>
        A special word to those on a “Retirement Visa”
      </strong>
      &#8211; It seems that the requirements for obtaining and renewing retirement
      visas can be dynamic. Almost every month brings an actual change or the
      rumor of one! It is important to keep informed about any potential changes.
      It is equally important to not be alarmed by the multitude of opinions
      and thoughts provided by those on social media!!
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some specific recommendations:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Talk to the people that you know
      </li>
      <li>
        Come to the Chiang Mai Expats Club monthly general meeting, where visa
        experts will always discuss any upcoming changes
      </li>
      <li>
        Speak with a reputable visa agent
      </li>
    </ol>

      Chapter 4.18 – Other Immigration Requirements for Expats
    </h3>

<div class="chapter-content">

    <p>
      In addition to visa extensions and renewals, there are several other immigration
      requirements that expats in Thailand should be aware of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>
          TM 30:
        </strong>
        This is a form that must be submitted by landlords or property owners
        to the Immigration Bureau within 24 hours of a foreign national's
        arrival at their property. Expats should ensure that their landlord or
        property owner submits this form on their behalf.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          90-Day Reporting:
        </strong>
        Expats who hold a long-term visa or extension of stay must report their
        address to the Immigration Bureau every 90 days. This can be done in person,
        by mail, or online.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Re-Entry Permit:
        </strong>
        If you plan to leave Thailand and return during the validity of your visa
        or extension of stay, you will need to obtain a re-entry permit before
        leaving the country.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Work Permit:
        </strong>
        If you plan to work in Thailand, you will need to obtain a work permit
        from the Ministry of Labor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Thai Bank Account:
        </strong>
        Many expats choose to open a Thai bank account to manage their finances
        in Thailand. Some banks may require a work permit or other documentation
        to open an account.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It is important to stay informed about these and other immigration
      requirements to ensure that you remain in compliance with Thai law.

    <ul>

        One popular option is the shop inside Meechok Plaza, which offers fast
        and high-quality service.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>
          Passport and visa service centers:
        </strong>
        Some passport and visa service centers in Chiang Mai also offer photo
        services. These centers often have experience with the specific requirements
        for different countries' passports and visas.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>

    <p>
      Making a plan for one’s end of life is important for everyone but it is
      perhaps even more important for those who are thousands of miles away from
      their home country and many of their loved ones. The Chiang Mai Expats
      Club presented a four-part series entitled
      <em>
        Prepare for End of Life in Thailand
      </em>
      . It was very popular and well received. The entire series was videotaped
      and is available from the CEC website:
      <a href="https://chiangmaiexpatsclub.com/" target="_blank">
        https://chiangmaiexpatsclub.com/
      </a>
      . You can find more information there - look for the
      <strong>
        learning tab
      </strong>
      at the top of the homepage.
