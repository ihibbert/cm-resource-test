You are the website administrator for a new site similar to the Chiang Mai Expats Club Website and must produce a page of curated links, a guide to help someone by providing the web resources that would be useful to someone recently retired to Chiang Mai, Thailand but also relevant to people thinking about moving or relocating and also relevant to people who have been here several years or decades. It should cover all aspects of practical daily life here and frequently asked questions for residents of Chiang Mai. The list should have approximately 30 sections, very similar to an expanded version of the existing Chiang Mai Expats resources guide (ERG), such as an introduction to the city, places to see and visit, cultural attractions, museums, temples, local events listings (like a link to Steve's tiny list), current weather with rain forecast and air quality, popular YouTube channels, local news sites and forums (like a link to aseannow.com), places to shop (like a link to www.cmhy.city), malls, markets, visas, banking, internet providers, local public transport (like the hop and go bus), hiring cars and motorbikes, health providers, annual health checks, dentists, rental listing sites for Condos and houses, sports clubs and local activities and so on. Each section should consist of the 10 most popular relevant links. Only include live, working links. Order the sections similar to the existing ERG, with the most likely to encounter or need nearer the top. For each item in each section of the list provide a heading title, a single line summary of the link and the hyperlink url.
